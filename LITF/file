Hey Juan,

Since yesterday, I have been focusing more on optimizing the Power BI file rather than just working on visualizations. Considering that this is going to be a long-term project that will remain with the company for a significant period, I decided to put more effort into the backend. For example, in one of the Power BI classes/meetings, Kasper mentioned using the DIM (dimensions table) for dates/calendar.

Anyway, the data on the graphs looks good and aligns with Tableau. That’s great news.

Let me know if you’d like further refinements!

this one is setup to run on the 1st business day of the month, but we can edit it.
 
-- If it's first business date of the week, then run the procedure

IF EXISTS (

	SELECT Calendar_Date

	FROM (

		SELECT Calendar_Date

			,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Calendar_Week ORDER BY Calendar_Week) AS row_num

		FROM edo.dbo.ref_Calendar_Days 

		WHERE YEAR(Calendar_Date) = YEAR(GETDATE()) and Is_Business_Day = 1

	) AS c

	WHERE c.row_num = 1 and c.Calendar_Date = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)

)

BEGIN
 
we can add this but change it to 5 and it'll run everyday but won't do anything unless it's the 5th business day
